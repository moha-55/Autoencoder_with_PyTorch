# Autoencoder Implementation in PyTorch

This project demonstrates the implementation of an autoencoder using PyTorch. Autoencoders are a type of self-supervised model that learn to reconstruct their inputs from a compressed latent representation. They are widely used for tasks such as dimensionality reduction, denoising, and feature extraction.

## Features
- Encoder: Compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation.

- Decoder: Reconstructs the original input data from the compressed representation.

- Gaussian Noise Layer: Adds Gaussian noise during training to improve the model's robustness.
