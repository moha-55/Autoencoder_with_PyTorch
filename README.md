# Autoencoder Implementation in PyTorch

This project demonstrates the implementation of an autoencoder using PyTorch. Autoencoders are a type of self-supervised model that learn to reconstruct their inputs from a compressed latent representation. They are widely used for tasks such as dimensionality reduction, denoising, and feature extraction.
